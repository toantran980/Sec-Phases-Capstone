# **Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive solution that has been developed in three phases: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Each phase represents a distinct milestone in the development of the project, and together they form a complete and functional system.

## **Phase 1: Foundation**

### Description

In Phase 1, we laid the foundation for the project by setting up the basic structure and implementing the core features. This phase focused on establishing a solid base for the project, including the development of threat intelligence and CVE analysis.

### Features

* **Threat Intelligence & CVE Analysis** : Conducted threat intelligence and CVE analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities and develop strategies for mitigation.

### Documents

* **Threat Intelligence & CVE Analysis.docx** : A detailed report on the threat intelligence and CVE analysis conducted during Phase 1.

## **Phase 2: Development**

### Description

In Phase 2, we built upon the foundation established in Phase 1 and implemented additional features and functionality. This phase focused on developing policies, redesigning the data center, and creating a memo policy review.

### Features

* **Policy Administrative** : Developed a policy administrative framework to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* **Data Center Redesign** : Redesigned the data center to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
* **Memo Policy Review** : Conducted a memo policy review to ensure that all policies are up-to-date and compliant with regulatory requirements.

### Documents

* **Policy Administrative.docx** : A detailed report on the policy administrative framework developed during Phase 2.
* **Data Center Redesign.docx** : A detailed report on the data center redesign conducted during Phase 2.
* **Memo Policy Review.docx** : A detailed report on the memo policy review conducted during Phase 2.

## **Phase 3: Deployment**

### Description

In Phase 3, we deployed the project to a production environment and ensured that it is scalable and secure. This phase focused on building a local virtual machines to deliver and deploy to Azure server (cyber server VM, metasploitable, and window server 2022), strength secure process to strong enoguh against outsider/cyber threats completing the post-completion, and creating a timeline for the capstone 3.

### Features

* **Building the VM** : Built a virtual machine to ensure scalability and security.
* **Post-Completion** : Completed the post-completion to ensure that all requirements are met.
* **Capstone 3 Timeline** : Created a timeline for the capstone 3 to ensure that all deadlines are met.

### Documents

* **Building_the_VM.pdf** : A detailed report on the virtual machine built during Phase 3.
* **Post-Completion.pdf** : A detailed report on the post-completion conducted during Phase 3.
* **Capstone 3 Timeline.docx** : A detailed timeline preparation, dificulties and deployment for the capstone 3.
